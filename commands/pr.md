# Create Pull Request

Automate the full commit-push-PR pipeline. This is a **git-only workflow** — never build or test.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (optional — additional instructions for this PR, e.g. `target develop` or `skip commit`)

## Steps

1. **Analyze changes**:
   - Run `git status` (never use `-uall`) and `git diff` (staged + unstaged) in parallel.
   - Run `git log origin/HEAD..HEAD --oneline` to see existing commits on this branch (if `origin/HEAD` is not set, fall back to `git log --oneline`).
   - Extract the **ticket number** from the branch name (pattern: `__BRANCH_PREFIX__/{ticket}-*` or `{ticket}-*`) or from commit messages. If not found, ask the user.

2. **Search project memories, previous decisions, and learnings** using keywords from the branch name, changed files, and commit messages. Look for:
   - PR conventions or templates
   - Architectural decisions related to the changed modules
   - Context or past issues in the affected areas
   Use whatever knowledge and memory tools are available in this project. Include relevant findings in the PR description.

3. **Stage and commit**:
   - Stage relevant files (prefer specific files over `git add -A`; never stage `.env` or credentials).
   - Describe **what** changed based on the **actual code diff** — the conversation may contain reverted attempts, bugs, or dead ends that don't reflect the final result. Use the conversation for **context and rationale** (the *why*), but never describe changes that aren't in the diff.
   - Commit message format: one-line summary + max 3 bullet points describing actual changes. Use HEREDOC for the message.
   - If there are no changes to commit, skip to step 4.

4. **Push** the current branch with `-u` flag if needed.

5. **Create the PR**:
   - If `.github/pull_request_template.md` exists, read it first and follow its format.
   - **Title**: `[TICKET_NUMBER] Brief description` — must be under 72 characters.
   - **Body**: Fill in Context/Acceptance Criteria from the commit history and branch purpose. Fill in Testing Steps. Do NOT include unrelated PR references or auto-linked issue numbers.
   - Use `gh pr create` with HEREDOC for the body.

6. **Report** the PR URL.

7. **Evaluate** whether this session produced extractable learnings, architectural decisions, or conventions worth preserving. Use whatever knowledge and memory tools are available in this project to save them.
